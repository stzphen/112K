Project Name: NBA 112K

Necessary Modules:  pyautogui,  pygame (for sound only), math, time, random, and PIL (for uploading pictures)

Description: Created for a 15-112 hackathon in under 20 hours, our game is a Fixed 3D environment simulating playing basketball.  There is a main menu page. Clicking on the "Help" tab will lead to a page of directions, with the option to go back to the main menu.  Clicking "Play" will take you to a character selection page.  Selecting a character will load images of that character that are used in game.  Our project uses projective geometry to take 3D points and project them on a 2D coordinate to simulate a 3D environment.  We used projectile motion and trigonometry for the shooting motion of the ball.  The shooting mechanism is determined by timing the sliding of a bar.  Making a certain amount of baskets will lead to unique sounds to be played.
